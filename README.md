SPGNN：Superpixel Perception Graph Neural Network for Intelligent Defect Detection

Hi！
This is a PyTorch implementation of SPGNN.
This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. We will release the source code once the paper is accepted.
Until then, you can contact Hongbing Shang (h.shang@stu.xjtu.edu.cn) to get more details about the paper and code in advance.
Thank you for your browsing！ (●'◡'●)
